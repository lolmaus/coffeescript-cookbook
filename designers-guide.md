# Designer's Guide

Start with the [Developer's Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/developers-guide) to get a test version of the cookbook up and running on your machine, and get started!

...welcome home.

The default color scheme is based on [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) by Ethan Schoonover.
